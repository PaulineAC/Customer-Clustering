# Customer Clustering

# Project motivation and description
Identifying different customer groups based on characteristics such as age and income can help us better understand a customer's needs and interests. Doing so can help develop targeted marketing strategies that are interesting to specific customer groups. In this project, I aim to identify different customer groups using supermarket data.

# Question
Which different customer groups can we identify in supermarket data?

# Outcomes
We were able to identify six distinct customer groups:
1) Young, mostly in relationships, with children. Relatively low income and spending. Have been customers for about two years but are not sensitive to promotions. Most purchases done in store, although web purchases relatively popular.
2)  Older, highest proportion of people in relationships, with children. Middle income and relatively low spending. Have been customers for about a year and are not very accepting of promotions. Most purchases done in store.
3) Oldest cluster, tend to be in relationships, generally without children. High income and high spending. Have been customers for just over a year. This group is relatively sensitive to promotions. This is the only cluster that does a substantial proportion of their purchases (about a third) via catalog
4) Young, mostly in relationships, with children. Relatively low income and lowest spending of all clusters. Have been customers for about a year and are not sensitive to promotions. Most purchases done in store.
5) Older, lowest proportion of people in relationships (about 61%), with children. Middle income but relatively high amount of money spent. Have been customers for about two years and are not very responsive to promotions. Most purchases are done in store, although web purchases are the most popular in this group compared to the other clusters.
6) Young, mostly in relationships, without children. Highest income and spending out of all clusters. Have been customers for about 1.5 years and are relatively responsive to promotions. Most purchases are done in store, although online and catalog purchases occur here too.

# Future work
- I would like to look more closely at spending in different categories (e.g. fruit & vegetables, meat, bread), so that promotions can be offered based on the customers' specific interests.
- This dataset was relatively small (~2000 customers). I would like to look at a larger dataset.
